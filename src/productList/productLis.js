    description: "Este es un libro de aventuras inverosímiles protagonizadas por vetustos aviones e intrépidos pilotos que aterrizan en pistas de barro y desafían las tormentas de los Llanos Orientales y la Amazonia para ayudar a construir media Colombia, que, a diferencia del Oeste americano, se ha colonizado no con caballos y carretas sino con aeroplanos DC-3. En un pequeño parque, frente al aeropuerto Vanguardia, de Villavicencio, hay dos placas de cemento con un par de listas desactualizadas en las cuales se leen los nombres de ciento noventa y dos pilotos muertos, la mayoría en accidentes. Alcaravanes que nunca regresaron.",

    price: 13.61,
    stock: 30,
    description: "A Promised Land is extraordinarily intimate and introspective—the story of one man’s bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the balancing act of running for office as a Black American, bearing the expectations of a generation buoyed by messages of “hope and change,” and meeting the moral challenges of high-stakes decision-making. He is frank about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad, open about how living in the White House affected his wife and daughters, and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment. Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible.",

Spanning two alphabetically arranged volumes, these commentaries reveal how the songs came to be and the people who inspired them: his devoted parents, Mary and Jim; his songwriting partner, John Lennon; his “Golden Earth Girl,” Linda Eastman; his wife, Nancy McCartney; and even Queen Elizabeth, among many others.

Here, he expands on his message of hope in an inspirational road map for living the way of love, illuminated with moving lessons from his own life. Through the prism of his faith, ancestry, and personal journey, Love Is the Way shows us how America came this far and, more important, how to go a whole lot further.",
